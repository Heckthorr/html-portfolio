<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hector Gallo, since a kid I've always dreamed of being a computer engineer of some sort.
As I grew older somehow that dream started fading, until one day it was forgotten altogether.
Between dealing with life's hard blows and setbacks, and struggling to find who I was, I wandered life for years working dead-end jobs.
I realized eventually that is not the person that I once aspired to be as a child. My brother looks up to me as if I was a hero...
My girlfriend supports me the best that she can on my quest to become a better man, I want to be a person worthy enough for her.
Worthy enough to provide for our eventual family, someone who doesn't say no to something because he doesn't have enough money.
I will prove to my family and my loved ones that they were not wrong to place their hopes on me...
So here I am years later, with the same dream I had as a boy, but with the skills and life lessons I learned as a man.
Here I am ready to take on this challenge without backing down. This is why I want to be a programmer, for my family, for my loved ones,
but most importantly, for the little boy who had that vision that he could achieve anything he set his mind to.
